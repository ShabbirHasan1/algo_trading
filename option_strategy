Notes:

1. Volatile Hours like morning and closing preferred.
2. Always have a POV on whether today Market will go up or down and favour the Call or Put side orders accordingly.

Strategy 1:
Settings:
1. 2 Minute Candle - BankNifty
2. Supertrend (7,2.8)
3. MACD (10,26,8)



Rule:

1. If Market gap up/down by more than 300 Points (~1%) then wait for next Supertrend.
2. If Market gap up/down by less than 300 Points (~1%) and if Supertrend of 1st candle not consistent with candle color then ignore and wait for next Supertrend.
3. If 1st Candle more than 300 points then wait for the next Supertrend, if less than 300 and in the expected direction of the Day then ride the wave.

4. If Supertrend is Green (just the start point):
	If HDFC Bank Supertrend is also Green:
		If MACD > Signal :
			Buy nearest ITM Call and wait for Exit:
				Exit - earlier of the two (MACD and Signal difference goes below -13, Supertrend Red)


5. If Supertrend is Red (just the start point):
	If HDFC Bank Supertrend is also Red:
		If MACD < Signal :
			Buy nearest ITM Put and wait for Exit:
				Exit - earlier of the two (MACD and Signal difference goes above +13, Supertrend Green)


For 1 minutes, use 5 instead of 10
For 3 minutes, use 15 instead of 10
